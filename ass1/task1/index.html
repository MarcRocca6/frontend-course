                <h1>HOW WALNUTS ARE IMPORTANT TO UNSW</h1>
                <p>
                    <p>There are three main types of walnuts found in Sydney:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span>Red walnuts; and</span></li>
                        <li><span>Non-red walnuts</span></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Walnuts really can't be oversimplified in terms of how they're eaten. It's actuall very simply. You grab one, you place it on your mouth, you swallow, you smile, everyone is happy.</p>

                <p id="text2">It's important to understand that walnuts have a lot in common with other kinds of nuts and their respective regions too.</p>
